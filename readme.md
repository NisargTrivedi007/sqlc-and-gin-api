# Golang API Learning Repository

This is a personal learning repository where I explore building RESTful APIs using Go. The project is not intended for production use but serves as a sandbox for experimenting with various Go libraries and patterns.

## Technologies

- **Go**: The core programming language
- **SQLC**: SQL compiler that generates type-safe Go code from SQL queries
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token implementation for authentication
- **Gin**: Web framework for building HTTP services in Go
- **PostgreSQL**: Database backend

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical playground for:

- Learning how to structure Go projects
- Implementing type-safe database interactions with SQLC
- Building authentication flows with JWT
- Creating RESTful endpoints with Gin
- Practicing proper error handling and middleware patterns
- Implementing graceful shutdown patterns

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure Go is installed
3. Install dependencies: `go mod tidy`
4. Configure your database connection
5. Run the application: `go run sqlc_api/main.go`

## Note

This is a personal learning project and is continuously evolving as I explore new concepts in Go backend development.
